## Project Overview
This project focuses on the detection and recognition of license plates from images and videos using advanced machine learning models. By leveraging YOLO V8 for object detection and EasyOCR for optical character recognition, this system effectively identifies and reads license plate information with high accuracy and efficiency
## Tech Stack
YOLO V8: Used for object detection to accurately locate license plates within images and video frames.

EasyOCR: Employed for recognizing and extracting text from the detected license plates.

Python: The primary programming language for developing the detection and recognition system.

OpenCV: Utilized for image processing and manipulation tasks.
NumPy: A fundamental package for numerical computations and handling array operations.

Streamlit: (under porgress) Used for creating a user-friendly interface to upload and process images/videos and display results.

## Key Features
High Accuracy: Combines the strengths of YOLO V8's detection capabilities and EasyOCR's text recognition efficiency.

Real-Time Processing: Capable of processing video frames for real-time license plate detection and recognition.

Versatility: Works effectively with images and videos under various conditions and resolutions.

User-Friendly Interface: (If using Streamlit) Provides an intuitive interface for uploading files and viewing results.

## Future Improvements
Enhance OCR Accuracy: Fine-tune the EasyOCR model for better accuracy with different license plate styles and fonts.

Improve Detection Speed: Optimize YOLO V8 model for faster processing in real-time applications.

Expand Dataset: Include a diverse range of license plate images for more robust training and testing.
